                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1', this)">Q1:How long does it take to tint my windows? <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A:The duration of a window tinting service can vary based on several factors, including the type of vehicle, the number of windows, and the complexity of the job. Generally, tinting all the windows of a standard sedan can take approximately 2 to 4 hours. If you're only tinting the front two windows, it might take around 30 to 45 minutes. It's essential to allow adequate time for the installation to ensure the best results and longevity of the tint.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: Is window tint applied on the inside or outside of the windows? <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A: Window tint is typically applied to the inside surface of the glass. This method protects the film from external elements such as weather conditions and debris, ensuring its durability and effectiveness. During the installation process, the film is often measured and cut on the outside of the window to achieve the correct size and shape, but the final application is on the interior side. **</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">Q3: How long should I wait before rolling down my windows after tinting? <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">A: After the window tinting process, it's recommended to keep your windows rolled up for at least 24 to 48 hours. This waiting period allows the adhesive to cure properly, ensuring the film adheres securely to the glass. Rolling down the windows too soon can disrupt the curing process, potentially causing the tint to peel or bubble.</div>
